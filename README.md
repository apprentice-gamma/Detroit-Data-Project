# Detroit-Data-Project

This project is about having a user enter in a street address in Detroit to find out if it is vacant or not.

### On web-server.js

web-server.js is a small node server that you can use to develop with locally. From your root project directory type 

`$ node web-server.js`

You should get a message like this:

`Http Server running at http://localhost:8080/`

You can open a browser window and point it to localhost:8080 and you should see your app.
